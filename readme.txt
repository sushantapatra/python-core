================= IDENTIFIER ==========================
An identifier is a name having a few letters, numbers and special characters _(underscore).
It should always start with a non-numeric character.
It is used to identify a variable, function, symbolic constant, class etc.

=> Python is a case sensitive programming language.
d is not equal to d
t is not equal to t
rahul is not equal to rahul

=================== CONSTANTS ===================
A constant is an identifier whose value connot be changed thoughout the execution of a program wheras the variable value keeps on changing.
=> There are no constant in Python, the way they exist in C and Java
